Project Overview:
The "Recipe Finder" is a web application designed to help users discover recipes based on ingredients, dietary restrictions, or cuisine preferences. Its primary goal is to simplify the process of meal planning and recipe discovery by providing users with a wide range of recipe options tailored to their specific needs.

****************************************************************************************************************************

Purpose and Goals:
- **Problem**: Many people struggle with deciding what to cook for their meals, especially when they have specific dietary restrictions or limited ingredients on hand. Finding recipes that match their preferences can be time-consuming and challenging.

- **Solution**: The "Recipe Finder" aims to solve this problem by offering a user-friendly platform where users can input their available ingredients or dietary requirements and receive a list of suitable recipes. This project empowers users to make informed and satisfying meal choices.


****************************************************************************************************************************

Features and Functionality:
1. **Recipe Search**: Users can search for recipes by entering ingredients they have or want to use, dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free), or preferred cuisine (e.g. African, Italian, Mexican).

2. **Recipe Display**: The application integrates with a recipe API to fetch recipes based on user input. Users can view detailed information about each recipe, including ingredients, preparation instructions, and nutritional information.

3. **Filter and Sort**: Users can filter search results by cooking time, difficulty level, or popularity. They can also sort recipes by relevance, rating, or alphabetical order.

4. **Save and Favorites**: Registered users can create accounts and save their favorite recipes for easy access in the future. They can also rate and review recipes.

5. **Meal Planning**: Users can add recipes to a meal planner to organize their weekly or monthly meal schedules. The app can generate a shopping list based on the selected recipes.

6. **User Profiles**: Registered users have personalized profiles where they can manage their saved recipes, meal plans, and account settings.

7. **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience.

8. **Optional Deployment**: For an extra challenge, the project can be deployed to a web server or hosting platform to make it accessible online, allowing users to access the Recipe Finder from anywhere.
